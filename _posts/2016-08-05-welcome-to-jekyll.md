My first issue with github pages was that I had to edit the HTML code every single time I wrote a post. HTML code is distracting, and I had to do a lot more effort than a seasoned blogger on an actual blogging platform. Think you're using instagram, but every time you post, you have to add the source in HTML code, and figure out the exact code snippet for the same.

## How did I fix this

After probably an hour of searching, I came across [CMS][post-cms]. This is exactly what I wanted - type the blog without typing into the code. A very simple solution would be just to link my domain with blogger or medium.com, but then I had no control whatsoever over the display and the platform policies. Github gives me a lot more flexibility with the display, and the platform restrictions feel reasonable.

### Wanting to cheap out

I could use a hosting service and some Wordpress tweaking, but that would cost me INR3000 to INR4000. Being cost-anxious, just like any other student, I wanted to have it all for free. Which brings me to the builder of this very site.

### [Stastic][post-stastic]

I used a static website builder, which had tools for me to update the pages without a single glance over the code. Other builders like Wix, Weebly, Squarespace etc. either advertise on your page or want regular payments; the goal I have is cost-free and ad-free. Stastic is the best builder I've come across till date. You can see the code, if you wish to, in the Github repository, and continue editing from that. I, however, like the simple interface of Stastic builder. Just see all the settings, and replace the names wherever you can. The homepage of this builder also presents you with all the steps you gotta take to set up your website, though most of the steps are intuitive if you've already used a website builder of any kind.
